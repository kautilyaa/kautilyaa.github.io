# About this repo

The repo is the source code for [jonnycarroll.dev](https://jonnycarroll.dev).

> Imitation is the highest form of flattery.

This site was edited by me using a combination of Jekyll, Tailwind and Alpine.js.
However, I would like to give a big shout out to [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/) for much inspiration.

I am happy to pay it forward. If you would like to fork this site
**please go ahead, but you must have attribution to [jonnycarroll.dev](https://jonnycarroll.dev) visible on your site**.
Maybe give this repo a star too if you do not mind.

Getting Jekyll and Tailwind to play together took a little bit of searching and tinkering but overall, the combination is super easy to work with.
Add in Alpine.js and overall you have a very quick and easy way to build ann interactive static website.
